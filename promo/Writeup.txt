Have you been applying for jobs at the major tech companies and are worried about the questions you'll be asked 
in the technical interviews?

Are you interested in what you need to focus on to prepare for future interviews?

Maybe you are a first year and wondering what will be expected of you be the time you graduate.

Starting Tuesday Feburary 29th, we will be hosting weekly programming tutorials where we will try to solve 
problems from the book 'Crack the Coding Interview' as a group. These are questions that have been asked in 
programming technical interviews in the past and are great practice no matter your programming ability (an year).

Being able to solve these problems will help your programming ability and your knowledge of the theory behind 
algorithms.

Stop by if you are interested.

What: Coding Interview Tutorial
Where: Breakout Room MCJ 328
When: Tuesdays 2PM - 3PM (starting Monday Feb 29)
